"""
Background monitor for session idle state detection.

Periodically polls all live tmux sessions and updates their state,
independent of whether any WebSocket clients are connected.

State classification is based on pane-content quiescence: Claude Code
(and other agent CLIs) animate spinners, timers, and token counters
continuously while working, so a frozen pane means the session is idle.
Each poll takes a short burst of captures (to avoid aliasing with the
animation period) and compares the tail fingerprint across bursts and
across polls.

Pattern-based overrides from :mod:`idle_detector` catch the one case
quiescence alone cannot: a pane parked on an approval/question/login
prompt (BLOCKED). "The agent exited/died" is not scraped from pane text —
it is derived from the process signal here (see :meth:`_mark_exited`).
